Having <Card> to be theme oriented, that means <CardTheme>.

Changes required:
1- Analyse every component (component/styles.js file) and target which property needs to be changed by theme. and comment that out.
For example, in <CardTheme> only background-color for Container will apply theme.
ps. What if more CSS props, in different HTML elements, need to be changed by theme?
One way is to give it an id (see CardTheme/index.js), which will allow to grab that item on GlobalStyles (see below).
ps2. The HTML element can also be grabbed by its tag, as long as it is unique in the entire system.

2- see ThemeConfig.js
 Basically it brings to the theme object (lightTheme and darkTheme) the CSS property to be changed/controlled by theme.
 In GlobalStyles variable, map the component (here by id) and apply the theme for that particular property.

3- The component (<CardTheme>) needs to have an id defined, so it can be picked on GlobalStyles (see above) - or a unique tag.
As stated in the first item above, when more elements need to have CSS props changed, apply id on it.
